## presentation of evaluation data characteristics
```


## Quantitative analyses {.tabset}

```{r}
## compute predictions for your evaluation data
## load packages needed for prediction:

preds <- augment(v, Sacramento)
```


### Overall model performance

```{r}
preds %>%
    metrics(price, .pred)
```

### Disaggregated model performance

```{r}
preds %>%
    group_by(type) %>%
    metrics(price, .pred)
```

### Visualize model performance

```{r, fig.height=3}
preds %>%
    ggplot(aes(price, .pred, color = type)) +
    geom_abline(slope = 1, lty = 2, color = "gray60", size = 1.2) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(vars(type))
```

### Make a custom plot

```{r}
preds %>%
    mutate(.resid = price - .pred) %>%
    ggplot(aes(longitude, latitude, color = .resid)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
    scale_color_gradient2() +
    coord_fixed()
```
